# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repository packages the pentest feature as one DSH bundle. `lib/` is the
published runtime surface: `pentest.js`, `storage-sqlite.js`, and the Web
client files are shipped by `npm pack`. Keep `cordis.patch.yml` aligned with
these exports. `src/` holds source snapshots, `packages/` their built
artifacts, and `tests/bundle.spec.ts` covers the patch. `preset/pentest/` is a
read-only system preset registered by the bundle. `README.md` is for end users;
keep contributor procedures here.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `npm pack`: create the npm `.tgz`; the release workflow renames it to the
  stable `dsh-pentest.tar.gz` asset.
- `dsh plugin --profile web add file:C:/path/to/<bundle>.tar.gz`: install a built
  bundle into a local Web profile for manual verification.
- `npm ci && npm test`: install the locked standalone test dependencies and
  run the bundle checks used by GitHub Actions.

## Rebuild Workflow & Compatibility

The checked-in source snapshots document how the published runtime files were
assembled. The release bundle itself is standalone; make host changes in
`src/dsh-pentest` and client changes in `src/dsh-client-ui-pentest`, then
regenerate the corresponding bundle files:

- host `lib/index.js` to `lib/pentest.js`;
- sqlite `lib/index.js` to `lib/storage-sqlite.js`;
- client `lib/client.js` to `lib/ui-pentest.client.js`, replacing every
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-pentest` reference with
  `@howmp/dsh-pentest/ui-pentest`.

For invariant changes, use `PACKAGE_NAME = '@howmp/dsh-pentest'` and
`dsh-pentest-invariant`; leave `lib/index.js` and `lib/ui-pentest.js` inert.
The bundle targets DSH `0.1.0-rc.6`; align peer dependencies and rebuild from
the matching upstream version when DSH APIs change.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Write TypeScript with two-space indentation, single quotes, and no semicolons,
matching the source snapshots. Use `camelCase` for values and functions,
`PascalCase` for React components and types, and kebab-case for Cordis row IDs
and files. Keep bundle exports and names under `@howmp/dsh-pentest`.
Do not edit generated `lib/` casually: keep it synchronized with its source
snapshot, then update the bundle patch only when composition changes.

## Testing Guidelines

Use Vitest `describe`/`it` tests named for observable behavior. Update
`tests/bundle.spec.ts` whenever changing exported plugin rows, routes, or their
required configuration. Preserve the upstream packages' 100% coverage gate and
add focused tests for domain, projection, or client changes.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Use concise Conventional Commit-style subjects, such as `feat: add asset view`
or `fix: configure sqlite path`. Describe rebuilt artifacts and the tarball
version, link issues, and attach Web screenshots for UI changes. Never commit
local DSH profiles, databases, or credentials.
