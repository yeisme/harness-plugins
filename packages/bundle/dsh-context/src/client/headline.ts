 * Provider-anchored headline derivation, shared by the Context tab and the

 * capacity it scales against, and the composition parts anchored to that
 * total (heuristic ratios, provider-anchored sum).
 *
 * Two official token-meter projections feed it, the same keys the chat's
 * composer ring reads: `contextPressure` supplies the anchored total (the
 * ring's percentage), and `contextBreakdown` supplies the composition
 * counts (the ring panel's system/tools/messages `~` rows) so the legend
 * figures stay identical to the panel's by construction. Either key absent
 * (older harness, meter not composed) degrades to the fold's own sums —
 * the same fixed estimator.
