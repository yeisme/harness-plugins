/**
 * Live tool→plugin attribution layered on the static recovery in
 * toolSources.ts.
 *
 * The session log records tools as plain `ToolSchema` entries (name /
 * description / parameters) — the registering plugin is not in there.
 * toolSources.ts derives the deterministic sources (harness-logged field,
 * `mcp:<server>` naming, pinned first-party map). This module additionally
 * watches RUNTIME registrations: cordis fires the `internal/get` waterfall on
 * every context read of a service property, passing the READING context as the
 * first argument, so `reader.fiber.name` identifies the plugin that is about
 * to call `register()`.
 *
 * - The `internal/get` handler records who last read the `tools` service and
 *   wraps that instance's `register` (once — an earlier wrapper of a previous
 *   hook incarnation is peeled back to the original, so a plugin reload
 *   re-wraps without stacking) to capture the reader at registration time
 *   into a live map. Every wrapper is undone when the plugin unloads: the
 *   original `register` goes back on the instance, unless a newer hook
 *   incarnation re-wrapped it first (that incarnation's own cleanup then
 *   owns the restore).
 * - When the reader slot is missing, root-named, or this plugin's own (e.g.
 *   LOCAL-LINK plugins — dev installs via `dsh plugin add <path>` or
 *   npm/pnpm link — whose anonymous entrypoints make cordis fall back to the
 *   root name), the wrapped `register` falls back to the call stack: the first
 *   frame outside this package is resolved to its nearest `package.json`
 *   `name`. That covers both npm installs (`node_modules/<pkg>`) and local
 *   links (any directory carrying a package.json), which never pass through
 *   node_modules. Frames that resolve back to this package are skipped.
 * - `ownerOf(name)` prefers the name-derived `mcp:<server>` label (it names
 *   the actual provider, where the live record would only ever name the MCP
 *   proxy client), then the LIVE record — for a post-boot registration it is
 *   the truth, even when the name collides with a pinned first-party tool —
 *   then the pinned map (the boot-time guess for tools registered before the
 *   hook), and finally tags tools that were ALREADY registered when the hook
 *   installed (the boot snapshot — third-party bundles, e.g. local links like
 *   dsh-file-claim, that applied before dsh-context) with the
 *   `UNKNOWN_TOOL_SOURCE` sentinel: their registering plugin is unknowable,
 *   and a bare gap would read as "no plugin" instead of "unknown plugin".
 *
 * Best-effort by design: a read separated from `register()` by an `await` can
 * be overwritten by another plugin's read (misattribution) and the stack
 * fallback needs a resolvable package.json — both degrade to the name/pinned
 * chain; registrations that predate the hook degrade to the unknown tag. The
 * hook costs roughly +1.4us per service-property read and is negligible on
 * the rare register path (the stack walk only runs when the reader slot is
 * unusable, and its package lookups are cached per directory).
